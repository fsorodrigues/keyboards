# Keyboard firmware

This repo contains the custom QMK firmware source used for my custom keyboards.

## QMK

The firmwares are built using the QMK framework to configure the keyboards.

## Layouts

One or more custom layout may be saved for each keyboard in addition to the default firmware (which we keep in hand in case of disaster).

Below are the keyboards currently configured with custom keymaps.

| Brand    | Keyboard | Special features                                              |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keychron | v10      | Home row mods, Two shift caps lock, remap of esc to caps lock |
